My name is Hannah and I'm a software developer.  Lately I've become very interested in functional programming in general and Clojure in particular.  I use vim at home and (mostly) IntelliJ at work.  I also really enjoy taking pictures and pretending to be a competent photographer. 

You can also find me on [GitHub](http://github.com/hlatki) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lessfunny).
